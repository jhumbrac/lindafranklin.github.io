<h3>My Background</h3>
<p> I began my career in marketing. First in print (Yes, I have THAT much experience) and then everything digital. I studied the best practices of AdWords and Social Media in the early days and then my career morphed into project management. I found that what I love and excel in is gathering data, creating plans, and developing effecient processes --much like web strategy! Managing many website builds grew my interest and curiousity in this area, particularly with AB testing and user experience. Many websites are beautiful and come with so many bells and whistles, but it is all for not if the customer doesn't know what to do!</p>

<p>I love to make processes beter and craft websites that present solutions</p>

<p>My skillset includes:<p>
<ul>
<li>Waterfall/Agile methodologies
<li>SEO
<li>Google Analytics (Certified)
<li>Google AdWords (Certified)
<li>AB Testing
<li>Visual Design
<li>UX/UI
<li>HTML/CSS
<li>Lead Generation</li>
</ul>
